You are asked to build a simple E-commerce Billing System using Python modules.
Create a module file named ecommerce_utils.py that contains the following functions:
apply_discount(price, discount_percent) → applies a discount and returns the discounted price.
add_gst(price, gst_percent=18) → adds GST (default 18%) and returns the new price.
generate_invoice(cart, discount_percent=0, gst_percent=18) → accepts a dictionary cart (with product names as keys and prices as values) and prints a detailed invoice.
Create a main program file named main.py that:
Imports the ecommerce_utils module.
Creates a shopping cart (dictionary) with at least 3 products.
Calls the module functions to generate an invoice.
Expected Output Example:
------ INVOICE ------
Laptop          : ₹55000
Phone           : ₹30000Headphones      : ₹2000
---------------------
Subtotal: ₹87000
After 10% discount: ₹78300.0
After 18% GST: ₹92454.00
